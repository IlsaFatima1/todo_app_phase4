# Tasks Quality Checklist: Todo AI Chatbot — FastAPI Backend & Chat Endpoint

**Purpose**: Validate task completeness and quality before proceeding to implementation
**Created**: 2026-01-15
**Tasks**: [Link to tasks.md](../tasks.md)

## Format Compliance

- [x] All tasks follow the required format: `- [ ] T### [P?] [US?] Description with file path`
- [x] Task IDs are sequential and properly numbered
- [x] Parallelizable tasks are marked with [P] tag
- [x] User story tasks are marked with [US1], [US2], [US3] tags
- [x] Most tasks include specific file paths where applicable

## Task Completeness

- [x] All user stories from spec are represented in task breakdown
- [x] Each user story has sufficient tasks to be independently testable
- [x] Foundational/infrastructure tasks are identified and scheduled appropriately
- [x] Dependencies between tasks/stories are properly accounted for
- [x] Error handling and validation tasks are included

## Implementation Feasibility

- [x] Tasks are granular enough to be completed independently
- [x] Tasks are specific enough for implementation without additional context
- [x] File paths are accurate and follow project structure
- [x] Technical approach aligns with architecture plan
- [x] Dependencies are properly sequenced

## Quality Assurance

- [x] Test tasks are included where appropriate
- [x] Cross-cutting concerns are addressed in final phase
- [x] Security considerations are addressed in tasks
- [x] Performance considerations are addressed
- [x] User experience considerations are addressed

## Notes

- [x] All items completed - Tasks are ready for implementation
