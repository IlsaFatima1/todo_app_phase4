# AI Agents Documentation

Welcome to the AI Agents documentation directory. This collection provides comprehensive information about creating, configuring, and using AI agents with the OpenAI Agent SDK.

## Directory Structure

- `openai-agent-sdk.md` - Complete guide to the OpenAI Agent SDK, including creation patterns, configuration options, and best practices
- `practical-examples.md` - Real-world examples of agents in various domains, including the RAG chatbot we built
- `skills-and-tools.md` - Comprehensive guide to creating and using tools/skills with agents
- `README.md` - This file

## Getting Started

### 1. Understanding the Basics
Start with `openai-agent-sdk.md` to understand the fundamental concepts of agent creation, configuration, and usage patterns.

### 2. See Real Examples
Review `practical-examples.md` to see how agents are implemented in real-world scenarios, including the RAG chatbot for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook that we built.

### 3. Learn About Tools and Skills
Check `skills-and-tools.md` to understand how to create and use tools that extend agent capabilities.

## Key Concepts Covered

### Agent Creation Patterns
- Basic agent structure and configuration
- Async vs sync patterns
- Model configuration with different LLM providers
- Run configuration options

### Tool Development
- Creating function tools with `@function_tool` decorator
- Input validation and error handling
- Security considerations
- Advanced tool patterns

### Real-World Applications
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems
- Research assistants
- Code review agents
- Data analysis agents
- Content creation agents

### Best Practices
- Environment variable management
- Error handling and logging
- Performance optimization
- Security considerations

## Quick Reference: Creating Your First Agent

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, AsyncOpenAI, RunConfig, OpenAIChatCompletionsModel
import os

# 1. Initialize the client
client = AsyncOpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY"),
    base_url="https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/",
)
model = OpenAIChatCompletionsModel(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    openai_client=client,
),


# 3. Create run configuration
config = RunConfig(
    model=model,
    model_provider=client,
    tracing_disabled=True,
)

# 4. Create the agent
agent = Agent(
    name="MyAgent",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant...",
    tools=[],  # Add your tools here
)

# 5. Run the agent
async def run_agent(query: str) -> str:
    response = await Runner.run(agent, query, run_config=config)
    return response.final_output
```

## Security Considerations

When creating agents and tools:
- Always validate inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Implement rate limiting where appropriate
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Test thoroughly with edge cases

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions are documented in each respective file. If you encounter problems:

1. Check environment variables are properly set
2. Verify API keys and endpoints
3. Ensure tools are properly decorated and implemented
4. Enable tracing temporarily for debugging
5. Review error messages and logs

## Next Steps

1. Read `openai-agent-sdk.md` for comprehensive understanding
2. Review `practical-examples.md` for real-world implementations
3. Study `skills-and-tools.md` to extend agent capabilities
4. Start building your own agents using the patterns described

This documentation is designed to be self-contained and comprehensive, so you shouldn't need to search elsewhere for basic agent creation information. All the patterns and examples you need are documented here.
